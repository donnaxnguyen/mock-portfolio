If you haven't yet, now is the time to update the following in your GitHub profile:


Profile picture


Bio


Location

Employers (and potential collaborators) will look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward.


Pin some repos that you want to highlight


Navigate to GitHub and go to your profile.


Click "Customize your pins"


Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share


Make sure each of these projects is deployed and add a link to the deployed project in their README files
